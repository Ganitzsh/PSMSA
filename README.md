# PSMSA

This is  my very own SMS Application for Android. It is meant to be used as the main SMS app from my phone - or someone else's. It all started with a few designs I made
using Illustrator. The look and feel of this app is mainly inspired by the MARVEL
universe.

** WARNING: This is still a work in progress **

## Current features

This app currently support the following features:

* Send SMS
* Receive SMS

** TODO: **

* MMS Reception
* MMS Sending
* Check if SMS/MMS sent

I will also add a few animations to make it feel less static and sad once every
vital features will be implemented.
